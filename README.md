* **Level:** Postgraduate level

## Welcome to Principles of Machine Learning in Finance - 2024/2025!
In this module, we’ll embark on an interdisciplinary journey to dive into the field of machine learning along with its primary application in finance.
We’ll learn about different types of machine learning (ML), their conceptual  relation to artificial intelligence (AI), and underlying models of both supervised and unsupervised learning.
The last but not the least. We’ll implement and enhance your knowledge of Python coding language while constructing and evaluating machine learning models to solve financial problems with such tasks as prediction, classification and clusterisation.

Looking forward to working with you all!

## Module Overview

Our Module serves to deliver an up-to-date knowledge of machine learning in finance, both theoretical and practical ones. It aims to become a starting point for your journey as a data professional.

This module incorporates elements of experiential learning where you’ll be able to apply an acquired knowledge of machine learning models to empirical financial implications with Python.
We’ll use real-world data along with synthetic data and world-known public databases like Kaggle sufficiently applied by data professionals to train, test and evaluate machine learning models.

In addition, we’ll rely on an essential Python library for machine learning Scikit-Learn and several packages, modules, and libraries needed for data analysis and visualisation.

It requires basic knowledge of Python-coding and statistics but is calibrated to deliver all the essentials you need to succeed in this module.
